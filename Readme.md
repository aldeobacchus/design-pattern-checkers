# Checker Project Design Pattern

## Compiling
#### To compile 
use : `g++ *.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall -o Checkers -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image` in the `Checkers` folder
#### To run
`./Checkers`

## Project info
The project unfortunately did not  have the time to be debugged and we therefore have a segmentation fault when choosing a piece.
